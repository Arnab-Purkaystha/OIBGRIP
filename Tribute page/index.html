                Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 â€“ October 18, 1931) was an
                American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's
                greatest inventor. He is credited with developing many devices in
                fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound
                recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the
                phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical
                electric light bulb, had a widespread impact on the modern
                industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the
                principles of mass production and teamwork to the process of
                invention, working with many researchers and employees. He is often
                credited with establishing the first industrial research laboratory.

                His first patent was for an electric vote recorder, which was granted
                on June 1, 1869.

                Edison's major innovation was the establishment of an industrial
                research lab in 1876. Edison began his career as an inventor in
                Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved
                telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider
                notice was the phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment was so
                unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison
                became known as "The Wizard of Menlo Park," New Jersey.

                In 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones
                (at that time called a "transmitter") by developing a carbon
                microphone, which consists of two metal plates separated by granules
                of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound
                waves.

                In 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination,
                something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting. Some
                of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high
                expense to produce, and high electric current drawn, making them
                difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison realized that
                to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable
                size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have
                to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must
                have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110
                volts).

                After many experiments, first with carbon filaments and then with
                platinum and other metals, Edison returned to a carbon filament. The
                first successful test was on October 22, 1879; it lasted 13.5 hours.
                Edison continued to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed
                for U.S. patent for an electric lamp using "a carbon filament or strip
                coiled and connected to platina contact wires". This was the first
                commercially practical incandescent light.

                Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931.
